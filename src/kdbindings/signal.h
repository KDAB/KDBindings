/**
 * @brief A Signal provides a mechanism for communication between objects.
 *
 * KDBindings::Signal recreates the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html">Qt's Signals & Slots mechanism</a> in pure C++17.
 * A Signal can be used to notify any number of slots that a certain event has occurred.
 *
 * The slot can be almost any callable object, including member functions and lambdas.
 *
 * This connection happens in a type-safe manner, as a slot can only be connected to
 * a Signal when the arguments of the slot match the values the Signal emits.
 *
 * The Args type parameter pack describe which value types the Signal will emit.
 *
 * Deferred Connection:
 *
 * KDBindings::Signal supports deferred connections, enabling the decoupling of signal
 * emission from the execution of connected slots. With deferred connections, you can
 * connect slots to the Signal that are not immediately executed when the signal is emitted.
 * Instead, you can evaluate these deferred connections at a later time, allowing for
 * asynchronous or delayed execution of connected slots.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - @ref 01-simple-connection/main.cpp
 * - @ref 02-signal-member/main.cpp
 * - @ref 03-member-arguments/main.cpp
 * - @ref 07-advanced-connections/main.cpp
